A CNN model to classify given image input into a whooping 131 different classes of fruits and veggies

Here we use the fruits-360 kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
to train a CNN model to learn to classify objects into 131 varities of fruits and vegetables

The dataset by default has about 90,000 images of which 75% are training images
images are of resolution 100x100 pixels
We have used InceptionV3 Architecture for Transfer Learning, as well as Data Augmentation

The 131 classes have been named in the pre-defined order and must not be changed
Model is trained for 30 epochs and gives reasonably good accuracy

(Be sure to follow certain in script instructions to get the o/p)
